# Adding new themes

Themes go inside `package/contents/ui/themes/`

Theme file structure:

```sh
ThemeNameExampleDir/
├── config
├── Example-eye.png
└── Example-pupil.png
```

Theme `config` file must have the names of eye and pupil images:

```ini
# config file
eye-pixmap = "example-eye.png"
pupil-pixmap = "example-pupil.png"
```

After adding a new theme run `./gen_themes_index` from the project directory, this will update `package/contents/ui/themes/index.json` with the new theme(s).

## Acknowledgements

These type of eye are grabbed from the projects:

- gnome-applet and its derived mate-applet
- Crystal theme from lxqt-plugin-qeyes
